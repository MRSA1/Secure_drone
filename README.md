## 🔒 What is Secure Drone Sync?

**Secure Drone Sync** is a lightweight Python-based library and simulation framework for autonomous drones that:
- Synchronize flight phases via distributed phase-coupling models
- Secure all communication using AES-GCM encryption
- Dynamically hop frequencies to avoid interception
- Use bio-inspired timing logic (like dolphin fish-kicking and predator coordination)

> Originally inspired by dolphin pack hunting behavior observed in Tampa Bay, this project uses real-time synchronization mathematics and secure messaging to build swarm-ready drone intelligence.
